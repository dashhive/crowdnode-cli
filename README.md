# CrowdNode CLI

CrowdNode allows you to become a partial MNO - staking Dash to earn interest,
participate in voting, etc.

This cross-platform CrowdNode CLI enables you to privately manage your stake via
their KYC-free Blockchain CLI.

# Install

## Node.js

You must have [node.js](https://webinstall.dev/node) installed:

### Mac & Linux

```bash
curl https://webinstall.dev/node | bash
export PATH="${HOME}/.local/opt/node:$PATH"
```

### Windows

```pwsh
curl.exe -A MS https://webinstall.dev/node | powershell
PATH %USERPROFILE%\.local\opt\node;%PATH%
```

## CrowdNode CLI

```bash
# Install to system, globally
npm install --location=global crowdnode-cli@v1
```

Or

```bash
# Run without installing
npx crowdnode-cli@v1
```

# CLI Usage

CrowdNode staking is managed with a **permanent staking key**.

The Dash you stake **can NOT be retrieved** without this key!

## QuickStart

You can use an existing key, or generate a new one just for CrowdNode. \
(I recommend printing a Paper Wallet (WIF QR) and sticking it in your safe)

You can preload your staking key with the amount you wish to stake, or deposit
when prompted via

- QR Code
- Dash URL
- or Payment Address

You will be given these options whenever the existing balance is low.

0. Generate a **permanent** staking key (just one):
   ```bash
   crowdnode generate ./privkey.wif
   ```
   (and put a backup in a safe place)
1. Send a (tiny) Sign Up payment (Đ0.00151072)
   ```bash
   crowdnode signup ./privkey.wif
   ```
2. Accept the Terms of Use via payment (Đ0.00085536)
   ```bash
   crowdnode accept ./privkey.wif
   ```
3. Deposit your stake (in Dash)
   ```bash
   crowdnode deposit ./privkey.wif 10.0
   ```

Key Management & Encryption:

    crowdnode use <addr>            # set as default key
    crowdnode passphrase            # set or rotate passphrase
    crowdnode import <keyfile>      # copy and encrypt key
    crowdnode encrypt               # encrypt all keys
